TRANSLATION_CRITIC_PROMPT = """"\
Review the markdown section translated from {source_language} to {target_language}. Respond only with "YES" if the criterion is fully met, or "NO <Explanation>" if there's an issue.

Criteria:
1. Is the translation semantically accurate?
2. Does the translation read naturally and fluently in {target_language}?
3. Is all markdown syntax preserved exactly as the original (headings, lists, tables, bold, italics, quotes)?
4. Are special symbols (e.g., emojis, mathematical symbols, special characters) preserved exactly?
5. Are all markdown links (anchor texts and URLs) unchanged and intact?
6. Are image alt-texts accurately translated without changing the markdown syntax?
7. Are numerical data, dates, measurements, and units preserved accurately?
8. Are all code blocks formatted precisely as in the original (no alteration)?
9. Are comments within code blocks accurately translated?
10. Is all executable code within code blocks unchanged and in the original programming language?
11. Is terminology consistently translated throughout the document?
12. Is the translation culturally appropriate, avoiding unintended changes in meaning?

If you respond "NO" to any criterion, provide a brief explanation.
