# 🌍 Lost in Translation

There was once a **tourist** who couldn't speak Norwegian, but tried very hard to communicate. He had learned a few
words from an app, but soon discovered that the language could be full of surprises.

## 📌 The Confusion

One day, the tourist wanted to greet some people in Norwegian, but was unsure how he would say "hello".

```js
// "How do you say 'hello' in Norwegian?"
console.log("Hello" + " in Norwegian is " + "Hallo!");
```

A little uncertain, but optimistic, he tried his best. Unfortunately it was not always easy to understand the answers he got back.

> [!QUESTION] **Where is the nearest train station?**
> The tourist asked a passerby for directions to the nearest train station, but misunderstandings arose quickly.

## 🗺️ The Road to Success

After some confusing conversations, he realized it might be useful to learn a few basic phrases:

| Norwegian 🇳🇴  | English 🇬🇧 |
|-------------|--------------|
| Hei         | Hello        |
| Takk        | Thanks       |
| Unnskyld    | Excuse me    |
| Hvor er...? | Where is...? |

By using these words, it became a bit easier to get around – although he still had to rely on gestures in between.

> It can be useful to learn a little Norwegian before you visit the country! Even just a few words can make a big difference.
